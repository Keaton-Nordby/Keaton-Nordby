Hi, I'm Keaton, and welcome to my GitHub! I'm passionate about technology and coding, and here you'll find a few projects that I've worked on. These projects demonstrate my skills in web development and data analysis using:

- **HTML** & **CSS** for building responsive and interactive websites
- **JavaScript** for adding dynamic functionality
- **Python** for general-purpose programming
- **NumPy** for data manipulation and analysis

Feel free to explore the repositories, and donâ€™t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or opportunities!

Looking forward to connecting!
