Hi, I'm Keaton, and welcome to my GitHub! I'm passionate about technology and coding, and here you'll find a few projects that I've worked on. These projects demonstrate my skills in web development and data analysis using:

HTML & CSS for building responsive and interactive websites
JavaScript for adding dynamic functionality
Python for general-purpose programming
NumPy for data manipulation and analysis
